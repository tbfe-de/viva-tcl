Presentation for a "one day" Training on Tcl - with some non-trivial code
examples to walk through at the end.

## Presentation

The presentation was originally written for a talk given during "PLC2-Days"
in Stuttgart-Korntal, on July 18, 2015.

It is published here under a Creative Commons "BY-SA" Copyright, which means:

You may use it freely for any purpose as long as you don't claim it is yours.
If you extend or otherwise improve it you should also share all modifications.

## Code

The code was written to have an example to walk through at the end of the
presentation - if time allows and participants express their interrest in it.

It is published under the MIT License, which means you may do with it whatever
you want, YOU NEED NOT SHARE ANY MODIFICATIONS, only one thing:

Don't hold me responsible if anything you learn or derive from the code fails.

## Future Directions

Surely there are still errors in the presentation - from typos to duplicated or
missing words, and maybe some could be improved (I'm not a native speaker of the
English language).

If you want to point out errors or have ideas for improvments, feel free to get
touch with me.

## Thanks

The presentation is based on the HTML5 tool "remark.js" - also available here as
repository on GitHub.

Thanks to to Ole Petter Bang for providing it!

For me, personally, it was a big boost in performance over the other "well-known"
presentation tools. Writing in "markdown" helps much to concentrate on content,
not appearance - though, of course, a final touch of the pages with an eye on a
"pleasing look" is not such a bad idea.
